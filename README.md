__DISCLAMER__

_This plugin has been tested with various CKAN servers (**API v3 supported only**), but each and everyone has its own quirks which might result in failed downloads._

The plugin queries the provided CKAN server, parse its response and tries to download resources according to the links provided in the response.
If the provided metadata contains invalid links the plugin of course fails to download the selected resources.

**Before opening an issue about a failed download please try to download the failing resource with a browser.**
If the download works in the browser then it might be a bug in the plugin.

1. Click on the resource
2. Click to copy resource link
3. Paste into browser and check if download works

`CKAN Browser Settings -> Miscellaneous -> Check "Show debug information in the 'Log Messages' panel"`
